# R Azima
# Leetcode #1 Two Sum : Given an array of int and integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target
# Created a hash map to store values from the array as keys and their indices as values.
# - As I iterate through the array,I calculate the complement of each element (target - current value).
# - If the complement exists in the hash map, I return the index of the complement and the current index.

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# - Traverse the array once, and hash map operations (insert + lookup) are O(1) on average.

# Space Complexity: O(n)
# - In the worst case, we store every element in the array in the hash map.
